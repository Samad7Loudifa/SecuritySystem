# SecureVisits

SecureVisits was born out of a real-world necessity: a family member owned a gated residential building and needed a solution to enhance security by monitoring visitor traffic and preventing unauthorized entry. Leveraging Angular, Node.js, and MongoDB, I developed a robust system that not only streamlined visitor management but also provided convenience and peace of mind for both residents and property managers.
